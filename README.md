# Apollo

Apollo is a comprehensive simulation software for epidemics in a population complete with within-host dynamics. It is powered by **CATE** our large-scale parallel processing architecture [MEE, CATE: A fast and scalable CUDA implementation to conduct highly parallelized evolutionary tests on large scale genomic data](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14168).

#### Description

Apollo is a stochastic evolutionary simulator for haploid viruses, designed to study the progression of a disease across a population. Apolloâ€™s simulations move forward in time, and it aims to facilitate the design of highly dynamic and robust simulation models for studying within-host viral evolution and disease spread.

As shown in the figure below to achieve this level of granularity in epidemic capture Apollo is based on three main hierarchies of simulation. It begins at the population level with the generation of contact networks that govern the transmission of the disease across the population. Next, it factors the host model, with the flexibility to implement heterogeneity in host types, accounting from tissue to cellular level dynamics with features to implement host behavioral patterns. Finally, Apollo accounts for evolutionary mechanics ranging from mutations, proofreading, recombination, and selection pressures.

#### How to INSTALL

To install Apollo you may have to compile the code using an nvcc compiler. If so execute the following on the terminal:

Download the repository:
````
git clone "https://github.com/theLongLab/Apollo/"
````
````
cd CATE/
````
*cuda 11.3.0 or higher*
````
module load cuda/11.3.0
````

Finally, compile the project:
````
nvcc -std=c++17 *.cu *.cpp -o "Apollo"
````
